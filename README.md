# **PrisonerSim**  
A simulation of the **Prisoner's Dilemma** game inspired by Robert Axelrod's research, designed to explore and test strategies against classical approaches like **Tit-for-Tat**.

---

## **Overview**  
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic problem in **game theory** that explores cooperation and betrayal between two players. This project replicates the game mechanics and serves as a platform to test and optimize strategies to outperform **Tit-for-Tat**, one of the most well-known winning strategies.

---

## **Features**  
- Simulates rounds of the **Prisoner's Dilemma** game.  
- Implements strategies, including **Tit-for-Tat**.  
- Allows for testing and exploration of custom strategies.  
- Results and comparisons are provided for analysis.

---

## **Getting Started**  

### **1. Prerequisites**  
Make sure you have the following installed:  
- **Python 3.x**  

---

### **2. Repository Status**  
This project is in its initial development phase. The simulation environment and strategies are **under construction**. Updates will be pushed regularly, so stay tuned!  

To get started, clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Programmer-cyberika/PrisonerSim.git
cd PrisonerSim
```

---

## **Planned Strategies**  
- **Tit-for-Tat**  
- **Random Strategy**  
- **Always Cooperate**  
- **Always Defect**  
- Custom strategies for testing and optimization.

---

## **Goals**  
The primary goal of this project is to:  
1. Replicate the game environment.  
2. Explore and develop strategies that can **outperform Tit-for-Tat**.  
3. Analyze results to gain insights into game theory and strategy optimization.
